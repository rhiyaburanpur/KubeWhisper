Current Kubernetes orchestration relies on a 'desired state' model. while the control plane effectively manages the quantity of replicas (e.g., restarting a crashed pod), it lacks the semantic understanding to diagnose the quality of the failure. A 'CrashLoopBackOff' event signals a persistent failure, but the resolution currently requires human intervention to interpret logs and documentation.
